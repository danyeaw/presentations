# GUADEC 2024 Proposal

## Title
Showing Up for Python in GNOME

## Content
In December 2022, Emmanuele Bassi wrote a [blog post](https://www.bassi.io/articles/2022/12/02/on-pygobject/) as a call
to arms to fix the undermaintained state of PyGObject and make improvements in a few key areas like fundamental types,
constructing and disposing objects, and documentation.

Since then, Arjan Molenaar and I joined Christoph Reiter as maintainers. Although there is still a lot of work to do,
the state of Python in GNOME has improved. This talk will provide an overview of:

1. The challenges of building up a GNOME community around an undermaintained project.
1. The exciting recent improvements to GNOME Python.
1. Where things are headed next and how others can help get involved.

## Talk Description

_Please provide a longer description of your talk for the event organizers. Helpful details to include are an outline of
your talk, what you think the audience will get out of your talks, and if the topic is technical._

### Who and Why (Audience)

I am aiming this talk at individuals who want to understand the current state of Python in GNOME, including some of the
new features. Attendees will require basic familiarity with Python programming and development of apps with GTK.
Experienced GNOME developers should still benefit from seeing an overview of the status and some of the more advanced
topics like fundamental type support.

This talk will be a mix of discussion about community building and technical topics.

1. A reflection of how PyGObject got in an undermaintained state, and some ideas and opportunities for GNOME to support
   projects to improve their contribution funnels that support maintaining the maintainers.
   
1. Technical discussion about recent improvements to PyGObject and some examples for how to take advantage of these
   enhancements in your own app.
 
1. Priorities to work on next and our vision for the future as a project.

The audience will leave with a deeper understanding of PyGObject. I hope that a subset of the audience will be
interested in getting involved and contributing enhancements, while using knowledge from this presentation to understand
the context of where things are and what some of the priorities are going forward.

### Previous Talk Experience 

I am the organizer of Michigan Python and I have given 14 technical talks about Python including three about building
GUI apps with GTK. In 2021, I spoke at the Linux App Summit with Arjan Molenaar about Making Your Application
Multi-Platform. In 2019,  I also spoke at PyCon about [5 Steps to Build Python Native GUI Widgets for
BeeWare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWt_sEZUiY8).

At work, I also started a technology users group that now has over 600 members, and I have taught many online and
in-person classes with up to 150 attendees each.
