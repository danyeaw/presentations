## Session Title
From Nights & Weekends to Nine-to-Five: Transitioning to Professional Open
Source Leadership

## Description

What happens when you transition from being a community contributor to leading
major open source projects professionally? This talk shares concrete steps
taken in the first three months of leading open source initiatives at Anaconda,
including creating an open source strategy, establishing project standards, and
identifying internal contribution opportunities. Rather than theoretical
approaches, you'll see real examples of bringing structure to open source work
in a corporate environment - what worked, what didn't, and what's still in
progress. Whether you're considering a similar transition or looking to bring
more structure to your open source work, you'll leave with practical examples
of how to approach these challenges.
Attendees will learn:

- How to develop an initial open source strategy
- Approaches to setting basic project standards
- Ways to identify internal opportunities for open source work
- Realistic views of early progress and ongoing challenges

## Speaker Biography

As Engineering Manager for Open Source Software at Anaconda, I lead teams
working on projects including BeeWare, PyScript, Jupyter, and fsspec. Over the
past seven years, I've been actively contributing to open source projects while
building the Michigan Python community as a leader and organizer. Prior to
joining Anaconda, I served as a Senior Manager for Functional Safety at Ford
Motor Company and as a Naval Officer. I'm passionate about making programming
more accessible and strengthening open source communities, particularly
focusing on projects that help newcomers build and share useful tools. In my
current role, I work to foster healthier collaboration and create more value
for Python users by connecting tools within the broader PyData ecosystem.
