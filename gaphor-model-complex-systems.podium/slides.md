# Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)

The formalized application of modeling to support system requirements, design,
analysis, verification and validation activities beginning in the conceptual
design phase and continuing throughout development and later life cycle phase
(INCOSE)

---

# MBSE is Rigorous Engineering

Three Components of Rigor:

- Language
- Abstraction
- Automation

---

# Language

- The Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is the open
standard for systems modeling

- Describe requirements, architecture, design, analysis, and testing
with precision

---

# Abstraction

- The key to engineering analysis
- Remove details for understanding
- Select the aspects that are relevant to answer the questions for this stage of development

---

# Automation

- Automated systems have highly repeatable effects
- Automatically validate designs for quality and consistency

---

# Abstraction Levels

- Concept Level - Define the problem to be solved
- Logical Level - Create solution agnostic to technical choices
- Technology Level - Create solution using specific technical choices
- Implementation Level - The built artifact

---

# Three Pillars of MBSE

- Behavior
- Structure
- Requirements
